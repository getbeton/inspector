# Beton Inspector

> RevOps intelligence platform that detects product-qualified leads (PQLs) by combining product usage, revenue, and firmographic data into actionable expansion and churn signals.

Beton Inspector is built for B2B SaaS revenue operations teams. It ingests data from product analytics (PostHog), billing (Stripe), and enrichment (Apollo) sources, runs 20 signal detectors to surface expansion opportunities and churn risks, then routes high-intent signals to CRM (Attio).

## Core Capabilities

- **Account Scoring**: Health, expansion, and churn risk scores (0–100)
