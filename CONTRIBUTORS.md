## How to Contribute

We welcome contributions of all kinds — bug reports, feature requests, documentation improvements, and code.

### Getting Started

1. **Fork** the repository
2. **Clone** your fork and create a feature branch from `staging`
3. **Install** dependencies with `npm install`
4. **Make** your changes
5. **Build** locally with `npm run build` (must pass)
6. **Submit** a pull request to the `staging` branch

### Guidelines

- Follow existing code patterns and conventions
- Write clear commit messages describing the "why" not just the "what"
- Ensure `npm run build` and `npm run lint` pass before submitting
- For UI changes, test on both desktop and mobile viewports
- For new features, consider adding relevant tests
